## Phase 6: Post-Setup Summary

After writing all files, report:

```
Test infrastructure created for [engine].

Files created:
- tests/README.md
- tests/unit/ and tests/integration/ — or the engine's test root
- tests/smoke/critical-paths.md
- production/qa/evidence/.gitkeep
[engine-specific files]
- .github/workflows/tests.yml

Next steps:
1. [Engine-specific install step,]
2. Write your first test in the engine's test root:
   tests/unit/[system]/ (or the engine's test root)
3. Run `/qa-plan sprint` before your first sprint to classify stories and set
   test evidence requirements. At `workflow: minimal` — the default — skip
   this: there are no sprints. At `qa.level: minimal`, also the default, tests
   are waived, so `/dev-story` writes none. Raise `qa.level` with `/settings`
   to have it write them
4. `/smoke-check` before every QA hand-off

Gate note: /gate-check Technical Setup → Pre-Production now requires:
- the engine's test root (`tests_root` from `engine.toml`, default `tests/`)
- .github/workflows/tests.yml
- At least one example test file
Run /test-setup and write one example test before advancing.
(At `workflow: minimal` that gate requires only the engine.)

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — test framework scaffolded and CI/CD wired up.
```
