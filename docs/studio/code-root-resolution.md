# Code Root Resolution

Shared procedure for any skill that reads, scans, counts or writes game source
files. **An unresolved code root means the check did not run.** This file gives
the resolution order.

`docs/studio/directory-structure.md` is the authority for which directory holds
code. This file is the procedure for applying it.

## The roots

| `engine.name` | Code root | Why it cannot be `src/` |
|---|---|---|
| Other (default) | `src/` | No constraint |
| Unity | `Assets/` | Unity compiles **only** `Assets/` and `Packages/` |

`src/` is the **default row of that table, not a universal path.**

## Resolution order

1. `engine.name` from `project.local.toml`, then `project.toml`.
2. `code_root` in `engine.toml`, when the engine layer ships one.
3. Derivation from the tree, but **only when it is unambiguous**. Exactly one of
   `src/`, `Assets/` or `Source/` present means that is the root. Two or more
   present means the project is genuinely undecidable — do not guess. Compare the
   names exactly as the directory listing spells them: on Windows and default
   macOS an existence test for `Assets/` also succeeds on a lowercase `Assets/`,
   which would make `src/` + `Assets/` look ambiguous and a lone `Assets/` look
   like Unity.
4. Otherwise: **unresolved.**

`python tools/studio.py project-state` (the `code_root` row) and `python tools/studio.py check` implement exactly this.
Skills must match its semantics so that a check and a skill never disagree about where the code lives.

## Unresolved does not default to `src/`

This is the rule the whole file exists for, and it is obligation 2 of
`rules/skill-authoring.md`: an absent value may not default to the
permissive one.

**For a read or scan:** report `NOT ASSESSED — code root unresolved` and say
which check did not run. Never report zero hits.

A scan anchored to a root the project does not use matches nothing, and
**nothing is indistinguishable from a clean result.** A localization check finds
no hardcoded strings; a security scan finds no secrets; a content audit counts
no implemented content; a stage detector counts no source files and calls a
finished project greenfield. Every one of those reads as a pass. This has been
found repeatedly across skills and hooks, which is why the resolution lives in
one place now.

**For a write:** do not write. Report the unresolved root and stop.

Writing game code to the wrong root is worse than a false pass, because it
produces a project that cannot build: on Unity, source placed outside `Assets/`
is never compiled and never appears in the editor, so the work is silently
inert. Resolving the engine in order to pick a specialist agent is **not** the
same as resolving the code root — a skill can do the first correctly and still
write to the wrong directory.

## Applying it

Where a skill says `src/`, read it as *the code root* and substitute the table
above. Where a skill greps, glob the resolved root. Where a skill writes,
write under the resolved root and use the engine's own conventions beneath it
(`Assets/Scripts/<System>/` on Unity).
