# Agent Roster

The following roles are available (34 in base). Each has a dedicated definition file in
`roles/`. Use the agent best suited to the task at hand. When a task
spans multiple domains, the coordinating agent (usually `producer` or the
domain lead) should delegate to specialists.

How strong a model a role needs is set by the `tier:` line in its own file; see
`model-tiers.md`.

## Engine-Specific Roles

Base ships no engine specialists. An engine layer (for example `game-studio-unity`) adds `roles/<engine>-*.md`, and the skills that need one resolve it as `<engine>-specialist` from `engine.name` in `project.toml`. With no such role, the skill says so and goes on without the specialist.
